description: ArchAI Autonomous Software Agent Flow (9 Domains / 11 Agents)
---

ArchAI is a pipeline of responsibility, converting founder intuition into structural technical system design and deployment via a multi-agent system.

### Domain 1: The Intake & The Gate
- **① Input Intake + Ambiguity Detector**: Generates a clarity gap report from user description.
- **② High-Leverage Clarification Agent**: Asks ≤7 questions to eliminate ambiguity (Who? Success? Compliance?).

### Domain 2: Product Spec
- **③ PRD Generator Agent**: Produces user personas, journeys, features, acceptance criteria (Immutable Truth).

### Domain 3: Architecture & Design
- **④ Constraint Analyzer + Stability Score Engine**: Numeric evaluation of "System Physics" (Moat).
- **⑤ Stack Bias Resolver + Guardrails**: Deterministic infra selection (No Hallucination).
- **⑥ Architecture Synthesis Agent**: Service decomposition, API gateway, auth, and diagrams.

### Domain 4: Engineering Planning
- **⑦ API Contract + Data Model Designer**: Typed API signatures, request/response schemas, DB table designs.

### Domain 5: Controlled Build
- **⑧ Code Generation Agents (Frontend + Backend)**: Parallel building of UI and Backend referencing the PRD.

### Domain 6: Quality Assurance
- **⑨ Static Analyzer + Test Generator**: Linting, test generation, and safety thresholds.

### Domain 7 & 8: Shipping
- **⑩ Deployment Strategy + Execution Agent**: Host selection (Vercel/AWS), CI/CD, Secrets, Infrastructure provisioning.

### Domain 9: Handoff
- **⑪ Handoff Summary Agent**: Live URL, Documentation, Roadmap, and Limitations summary.
